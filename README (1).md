# Colored Boxes Layout

This project displays a simple layout of colored boxes based on the provided image structure.

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the boxes.
* `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the boxes with colors and layout properties.

## How to Run

1.  Save the `index.html` and `styles.css` files in the same directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

You should see a layout with three rows of colored boxes:

* A large red box at the top.
* Two equally sized yellow and green boxes in the middle row.
* A large blue box at the bottom.

You can easily customize the colors and sizes of the boxes by modifying the `styles.css` file.
